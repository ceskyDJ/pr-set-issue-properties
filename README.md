### Input

| Name | Desc | Type | Required |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| token | GitHub token | string | âœ– |

- `title`: The PR title. Will only match like
  - fix: fix other #123 #456 #789
    - Get: 123 456 789
  - refctore: use other #222 #333#44
    - Get: 222 33344
  - So you should start with a space # and end with a space
- `body`ï¼šThe PR body
  - Like: https://github.com/actions-cool/pr-extract-issues/pull/4
  - Support for Github issue linking (`close #n`, `fix #n`, `resolve #n`, ...)
  - New linking (without closing issues): `issue #n`, `task #n`
- `commit`: Like `title`
- `filter-label`: Note that github default hooks. That is, `fix` `close` `resolve` directly followed by issue number will be closed after success merge
- `issues-labels`: Support multiple, need to be separated by comma
- `issues-comment`: `${number}` will be replaced with the current pull request number
- `issues-close`: Whether close issue

### Output

- `issues`: Get issues numbers
